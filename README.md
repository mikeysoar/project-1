## Introduction 
Working as a team we created an app where users can choose their music playlist based of their mood or artist of their choosing.

## Challenges
I think we collectively struggled with the initial Git process, being able to all make changes, push and pull. The javascript portion was also challenging to figure out. 
> Finding free APIs has been difficult.

---
## Victories
We easily constructed our HTML and CSS together and work very well together.
Our project is put togther and working by 06/09 for presentations.
Learning how to intigrade our APIs and getting them working.
