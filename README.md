## Description
Challenge: Group project 1 using Web APIs

## Introduction 
Working as a team we created an app where users can choose their music playlist based of their mood.

## Challenges
I think we collectively struggled with the initial Git process, being able to all make changes, push and pull. The javascript portion was also challenging to figure out. 
> Finding free APIs has been difficult.

## Victories
We easily constructed our HTML and CSS together and work very well together.
