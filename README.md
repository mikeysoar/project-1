# Application Description
This was the first frontend project we did as a group where we had to use two urls to get data from two differnt websites. The members of our group were Michael, Kiessa, and I. We originally had the idea to make a website where people can search for songs from any artist based on their mood. Eventually we had to settle for a website that can look all the songs of a certian artist with a story generator due to difficulties of getting the information of the fetch requests to show up on the website. In conclusion the application originally tried to solve the problem of allowning a user to find any song to reflect what they were feeling, but evetnually turned into allowing the user to access any song they wanted to hear from a single artist. 

# Application Orgnaization
Initailly we organized how the app was going to be coded from the ground up by giving each other specific roles to accomplish. Kiessa was given the role of styling the applicaiton with CSS, Michael was given the role of creating the html for the webiste, and I was given the role of handling the javascript that would have the fetch requests functional. All three of us were able to fulfill our foles for the first few days of getting the project done before we started running into complications. One complication were Kiessa becoming really busy with her schedule and not having lots of time to get her part done. The other complicaiton was Kiessa and Michael not being able to push their changes for the website onto the repostiory while I was the only one who was able to get his changes pushed up. Because of these complications I was given the responsiblity to act as the backup if Michael and Kiessa ever needed it. 

The layout we decided on for the website was having the cards with the searchbox on the lefthand side of the webiste. The boxes that conatianed the name of the songs and the random stories were put next to the search boxes. The header section has the title of the website with links to the songs and the randomly generated music stories. The footer section has all of our names along with the name of the hypothetical company we created this website for.

## Challenges
I think we collectively struggled with the initial Git process, being able to all make changes, push and pull. The javascript portion was also challenging to figure out. 
> Finding free APIs has been difficult.

## Victories
